	- Badge is not updated at startup, only once you open it at least once

	- You'll see instant events stuff in the js directory but none of it is used

	- Rename Cupid to Popup?


	- I think times will not be relative.  The gns json needs to be modified to extend each
	  notification object with not just a timestamp, but that timestamp eval'd to be local
	  with time.pub

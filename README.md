OkCupid Extension
=

This Chrome extension brings your OkCupid notifications to your browser.

Currently this extension keeps you signed in while it is turned on, which is the
main reason it isn't promoted in any way. Access to notifications while logged
out would require a server-side change at OkCupid.

#### Features

* Desktop notifications
* Sound notifications
* Mute Quiver

#### ToDo

* UI is not up-to-date
* Logging out causes notification number to appear
